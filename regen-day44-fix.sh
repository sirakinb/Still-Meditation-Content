STYLE="Digital illustration in a bold social media card style for TikTok. The character is a muscular purple humanoid mascot (smooth purple skin, athletic muscular build, no web patterns, clean smooth head). Clean vector-like illustration with bold outlines, similar to fitness influencer cartoon mascots. Eyes are NORMAL friendly cartoon eyes with visible dark pupils and whites — never glowing or empty. Background: calm zen meditation room with wooden floors, soft natural light, green plants. DO NOT include any text branding or logo anywhere. Light warm background with rounded corners. Text should be bold, large, left-aligned, and highly readable for mobile viewing. 4:5 portrait orientation. Only ONE instance of the mascot per image."

generate_slide 1 "Create a bold TikTok social media card illustration. ${STYLE}
Layout: Text occupies the LEFT 60% of the card. The mascot is on the FAR RIGHT, fully inside the right 40%, with NOTHING in the left text zone.
The scene: The mascot sits cross-legged on a cushion, eyes softly closed, calm composed expression.
Render the text EXACTLY as written, character by character, with no repeated words.
Large bold left-aligned headline text at the top reads exactly: MEDITATION GOT BORING.
LEAVE A CLEAR GAP between headline and body.
Below in medium bold text, render exactly these two lines and nothing else:
Good.
That means it works.
Do not repeat any words. Do not add extra words."
